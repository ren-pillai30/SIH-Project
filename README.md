# SIH-Project
An AI-powered model to predict crop yield based on historical agricultural data. This project uses machine learning to forecast production and identify key factors for optimizing harvest.

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective is to build a reliable prediction model that can:
1.  **Forecast Crop Yield:** Accurately predict the yield (tons per hectare) for a given crop in a specific location and year.
2.  **Identify Key Factors:** Analyze which features (e.g., area, crop type, district) have the most significant impact on yield.
3.  **Enable Optimization:** Provide a foundation for a recommendation system that can suggest strategies to improve agricultural output.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Robust scripts to handle missing values and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Random Forest Model:** Utilizes a `RandomForestRegressor` for its high accuracy and ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships.
- **Yield Prediction:** A trained model capable of predicting yield based on inputs like `State`, `District`, `Crop`, `Season`, and `Area`.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Visualizations to show the most influential factors affecting crop yield.
- **Performance Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using metrics like **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **R¬≤ Score**.
